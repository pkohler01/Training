# Introduction to CSS3
by University of Michigan

## About this Course
The web today is almost unrecognizable from the early days of white pages with lists of blue links.  Now, sites are designed with complex layouts, unique fonts, and customized color schemes.   This course will show you the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).  The emphasis will be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code, and how to establish good programming habits.     

When done correctly, the styling of a webpage can take enhance your page.   When done incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all.    To ensure that your sites do not put up  barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines.    Upon completion of the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page.  Using that design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and  layouts.    

This is the second course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.   Subsequent courses focus on adding interaction with JavaScript and enhancing the styling with responsive design.

It will be difficult to complete this course if you do not have access to a laptop or desktop computer for the homework.

## Assignment
Steps:

Create a file called hw1.css and save it in your css folder.

Style the page using the following rules:

1) Style the header with a background color

2) h1 elements should be centered and have a new font color

3) h2 elements should have a new font color

4) Sections should have a new background color

5) The links should  have a new font color and background color (**NOTE: earlier version of this assignment required that the link be centered.  So if someone has centered them, do not deduct points.)

6 ) The images should not appear on the page

I have included a video showing examples of each of these styles. The video goes beyond the requirements, but it is probably a good starting point and it is a nice way to see the end results. You can watch it here, or follow on to the next link in the course. https://www.coursera.org/teach/introcss/author/lecture/ta7aA/video-subtitles
